## Hi !

You have landed on the Homepage of my Personal Blog!. It represents a from of internet blogging that is commonly reffered to as "E/N" or Everything and Nothing 
at Once. This is primarily a space for sharing my thoughts, ideas and inspirations with the large empty void that is the INTERNET. 

### What is The Other Side ?

Above all, I have a facination for what lies on the "Other Side". And no I am not talking about finding alien life, but rather a search to finding out what lies on the other side of the spectrum. I have always been facinated by the diversity of thought, opinions and ideas. Which is why I named my blog "The Other Side". In a time when polarisation of thought has made it very difficult for people to develop an objective opinion, the "Other Side" is a facet that not many people notice and is often unrepresented.
