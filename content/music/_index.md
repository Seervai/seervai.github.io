title: The Music Blog
---

So I started learning Hindustani Classical Music when I was about 6 years old, and since then I have loved everything to do with music. I dabble (ameturishly) in music production, and love spending my time listening to music and trying to scour for new "tastemakers". I figured that I needed a place to share my love for this art and this is how the Music Blog came into place ! I hope you enjoy
