<h2 id="hi-">Hi !</h2>
<p>You have landed on the Homepage of my Personal Blog!. It represents a from of internet blogging that is commonly reffered to as &ldquo;E/N&rdquo; or Everything and Nothing at Once. This is primarily a space for sharing my thoughts, ideas and inspirations with the large empty void that is the INTERNET.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-other-side-">What is The Other Side ?</h3>
<p>Above all, I have a facination for what lies on the &ldquo;Other Side&rdquo;. And no I am not talking about finding alien life, but rather a search to finding out what lies on the other side of the spectrum. I have always been facinated by the diversity of thought, opinions and ideas. Which is why I named my blog &ldquo;The Other Side&rdquo;. In a time when polarisation of thought has made it very difficult for people to develop an objective opinion, the &ldquo;Other Side&rdquo; is a facet that not many people notice and is often unrepresented.</p>
